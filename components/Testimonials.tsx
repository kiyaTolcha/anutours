      title: "Excellent chance to see the countryside and also important sites",
      review: "Dagi and George gave us an excellent tour to the Monastery and the Portuguese Bridge. Dagi answered all our many questions and George drove patiently and well in the challenging traffic. We had a delicious lunch near the Portuguese Bridge and even indulged in shoulder dancing. We saw the countryside and got a better idea of the country than just staying in the city. I would heartily recommend this tour.",

      title: "Great Layover Tour",
      review: "Joseph was a wonderful guide. He was enthusiastic and friendly, as well as informative and insightful. We were in the city for a long layover and decided to spend the time seeing a little of the area. We stopped at Mount Entoto, the local market, the Ethnographic Museum, and the former estate. Joseph made sure we hit the highlights in a relatively short time, including a final stop at a lovely converted train station serving delicious coffee. I highly recommend this tour!",

      review: "Abe was a great tour guide. Very knowledgeable and kind. George was our driver. He was patient and a very good driver. I think our experience exceeded my expectations. This was our first trip and I was nervous but it was fun and I learned a lot in one day about the history and culture.",

Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable, sharing great insights about the country. The trip itself was well-organized, with a mix of historical sites and beautiful nature. The accommodations were comfortable, and transportation was smooth. Overall, it was a great experience!",
